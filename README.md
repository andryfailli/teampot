TeamPot
=======
TeamPot is a tool that extends Google Apps collaboration capabilities with team task management. 

Using this tool, team members will be able to share and discuss information about a project, create and assign tasks with due dates and reminders, schedule team meetings. 
TeamPot provides an enhanced collaborative workspace fully integrated with Google Apps (Groups, Drive, Calendar, Hangouts, GMail).
Furthermore, all users' actions will be recorded using BigQuery for collaboration pattern analysis and analytics.

TeamPot is built on top of Google Cloud Platform as an App Engine Java application. 

The backend is implemented using Cloud Endpoints and the information model is persisted in Cloud Datastore. The application is fully integrated with Google Apps services using Google APIs. Authentication and authorization process is implemented using Google sign-in button and one-time code flow through Cloud Endpoints. 

The web frontend implements Material Design specs and it's built using AngularJS and Angular Material.

I've designed and develop this project during my fantastic 6 months internship in Google in 2014/2015.
If you are interested, feel free to contribute to the project!

More documentation will be published in a few days.
